## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher
- **npm**: Version 8 or higher
- **OpenAI API Key**: Optional, but recommended for AI assistance features

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following optional variable:

```env
# OpenAI Integration (Optional - for AI assistance)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Application Settings
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
```

### Optional Environment Variables

1. **OPENAI_API_KEY**: 
   - Get from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Used for: AI-powered coding assistance and help features
   - Note: Users can also provide their own API keys through the application interface
   - If not provided, AI features will prompt users to enter their own API key

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shaneosullivan/JsTutor.git
   cd JsTutor
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env file with your actual values
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open the application**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your browser
   - The application serves both frontend and backend on the same port

## Available Scripts

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server with hot reload

# Production
npm run build        # Build frontend and backend for production
npm start           # Start production server

# No database setup required - uses in-memory storage and localStorage

# Code Quality
npm run lint        # Run ESLint
npm run type-check  # Run TypeScript type checking
```

## Key Features Explained

### Course Structure

1. **Basics Course** (Canvas-based): Fundamental programming concepts with visual output
2. **Array Methods Course** (PrintData): Working with arrays and data manipulation
3. **DOM Manipulation Course** (iframe): Building interactive web pages
4. **Algorithms Course** (PrintData): Logic, recursion, and problem-solving
5. **Remote Data Course** (API integration): Fetching and working with external data

### AI Integration

- Users can provide their own OpenAI API keys for personalized assistance
- AI provides contextual help based on current code and errors
- Child-friendly explanations and guidance
- Automatic error detection and debugging suggestions

### Progress Tracking

- Tutorial completion stored in browser localStorage
- Course unlocking based on prerequisites
- Automatic resume functionality - returns users to last visited course
- Star-based reward system for completed tutorials

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Tutorials

1. Edit `server/storage.ts` to add tutorial data to the `initializeTutorials()` method
2. Tutorials are automatically ordered and unlocked based on completion
3. Use appropriate course types: 'canvas', 'printData', or 'iframe'

### Adding New Courses

1. Add course definition in `server/storage.ts` in the `initializeCourses()` method
2. Create corresponding tutorials for the course
3. Set `requiredCourse` for course dependencies

### Canvas API Functions

The platform provides a rich set of drawing functions for visual programming:

```javascript
// Basic drawing
drawPixel(x, y, color)
drawCircle(x, y, radius, color)
drawLine(x1, y1, x2, y2, color)
drawRect(x, y, width, height, color)
drawText(x, y, text, color)

// Canvas management
clearCanvas()

// Event handling
onKeyPress(callback)
onArrowKeys(callback)
onSpaceBar(callback)
isKeyPressed(key)
```

## Deployment

### Replit Deployment
This project is optimized for Replit deployment with built-in environment variable management.

### Traditional Hosting
1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Set environment variables on your hosting platform
3. Start the server: `npm start`
4. Ensure port 5000 is accessible (or set custom PORT environment variable)

### Storage
The application uses:
- **In-memory storage** for course and tutorial data (resets on server restart)
- **localStorage** for user progress and tutorial completion (persists in browser)
- No database setup required

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **OpenAI API errors**: Verify your API key is valid and has sufficient credits
2. **Port conflicts**: Change the PORT environment variable if 5000 is in use
3. **Module not found**: Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
4. **TypeScript errors**: Run `npm run type-check` to identify type issues

### Performance Optimization

- The application uses debounced code execution (500ms) to prevent errors during typing
- Tutorial progress is cached in localStorage for instant loading
- Canvas operations are optimized for smooth visual feedback
