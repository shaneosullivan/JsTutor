## What are Let and Const?

You might already know about `var` - it's like a box where you can store things. But JavaScript has two **newer and better** ways to store things: `let` and `const`.

### 🆕 What's Different About Let?

`let` is like `var` but **smarter**! It only works in the place where you create it, and you can change it later.

### 🔒 What's Different About Const?

`const` is like a **locked box** - once you put something in it, you can't change it!

### 🤔 Why Should We Use Them?

- **`let`** prevents accidents where you might use a variable before you create it
- **`const`** prevents accidents where you might change something you didn't mean to change
- They make your code **safer** and **easier to understand**

### 📝 The Rules:

1. **`let`** - can be changed, only works in its "block" (between `{}`)
2. **`const`** - cannot be changed, also only works in its "block"
3. **`var`** - can be changed, works everywhere (this can cause problems!)

### 🎯 Your Mission:

Try the examples and see how `let` and `const` work differently than `var`!
