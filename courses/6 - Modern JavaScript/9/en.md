## What are Closures?

Closures are **magical functions** that can **remember** variables from the place where they were created! It's like giving a function a **backpack** full of memories that it carries around forever.

### 🤔 Why Are Closures Cool?

Imagine you have a friend who remembers everything you told them, even after you stop talking. That's what closures do - they remember variables from their "home" even after leaving!

### 🎯 How Closures Work:

1. You create a function inside another function
2. The inner function can use variables from the outer function
3. Even after the outer function finishes, the inner function **still remembers** those variables!

### 📝 Real-Life Example:

Think of a **treasure chest** (outer function) that contains **gold coins** (variables). You give someone a **key** (inner function) to the chest. Even if you move the chest away, the key still works because it **remembers** which chest it belongs to!

### 🚀 Why Do We Need Closures?

- **Private variables** - Keep some variables hidden and safe
- **Function factories** - Create customized functions
- **Event handlers** - Remember data when buttons are clicked
- **Callbacks** - Remember context when functions are called later

### 🎮 Your Mission:

Learn to create functions that remember things using closures!
