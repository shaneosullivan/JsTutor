## What are Promises?

A Promise is like when you **promise** to do something, but it might take some time! For example, if you promise to clean your room, you might:
- ✅ **Keep your promise** (success!)
- ❌ **Break your promise** (failure!)

### 🤔 Why Do We Need Promises?

Sometimes in programming, things take time:
- Loading a picture from the internet
- Asking a server for information
- Reading a big file

We don't want our program to **freeze** while waiting, so we use Promises!

### 🎯 How Promises Work:

1. **Pending** - "I'm still working on it!"
2. **Fulfilled** - "I did it! Here's the result!"
3. **Rejected** - "Sorry, something went wrong!"

### 📝 Promise Language:

- **`.then()`** - "When you succeed, do this!"
- **`.catch()`** - "If something goes wrong, do this!"
- **`.finally()`** - "No matter what happens, do this at the end!"
