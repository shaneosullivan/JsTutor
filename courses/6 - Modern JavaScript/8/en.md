## What are Higher-Order Functions?

Higher-order functions are **super cool functions** that can:
1. Take other functions as **parameters** (inputs)
2. Return other functions as **results**

Think of them as **function machines** that can use other functions as tools!

### 🤔 Why Are They Awesome?

Instead of writing the same code over and over, you can:
- **Reuse** the same logic with different functions
- Make your code **more flexible**
- Create **powerful combinations** of simple functions

### 🎯 Real-Life Example:

Imagine you have a **magic box** that can:
- Take a list of numbers
- Take a **rule** (function) for what to do with each number
- Apply the rule to every number

That's exactly what `map()` does!

### 📝 Common Higher-Order Functions:

- **`map()`** - Transform each item in an array
- **`filter()`** - Keep only items that pass a test
- **`reduce()`** - Combine all items into one value
- **`forEach()`** - Do something with each item

Learn to create and use higher-order functions to make your code super powerful!
