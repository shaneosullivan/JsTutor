## Problem Solving Strategies

**Breaking down big problems** into smaller ones is the key to solving anything!

### 🔍 What You'll Learn:

- **Divide and conquer** approach
- How to identify patterns
- Step-by-step problem solving

### Problem Solving Steps:

1. **Understand** the problem
2. **Break it down** into smaller parts
3. **Solve** each part individually
4. **Combine** solutions together
5. **Test** and refine

### Example Strategy:

```javascript
// Complex problem: Sort and remove duplicates
function sortAndRemoveDuplicates(arr) {
    // Step 1: Remove duplicates
    let unique = [...new Set(arr)];
    
    // Step 2: Sort the array
    return unique.sort((a, b) => a - b);
}
```
