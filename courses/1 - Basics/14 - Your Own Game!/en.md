## Your Own Game!

**Congratulations!** You've learned all the basics of programming and game development. Now it's time to create something totally your own!

### üéØ What You Can Build:

- A different type of game (Pong, Pac-Man style, platformer)
- An interactive art program
- A physics simulation
- A drawing tool with special effects
- Your own twist on Snake

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools You've Mastered:

- **Drawing** shapes and colors
- **Variables** and maths
- **Loops** and patterns
- **Random numbers**
- **Animation** with `setInterval`
- **Keyboard controls**
- **Game logic** and collision detection

### Programming Concepts You Know:

```javascript
// Variables and Math
let score = 0;
score += 10;

// Loops and Patterns
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    drawCircle(i * 50, 200, 20, 'blue');
}

// Conditions and Logic
if (player.x > enemy.x) {
    // Player is to the right
}

// Animation and Interaction
setInterval(() => {
    // Game loop
}, 100);
```

### üåü Your Challenge:

Start with a blank canvas and create something **amazing**! Don't be afraid to experiment, break things, and try new ideas. Programming is all about creativity and problem-solving!
