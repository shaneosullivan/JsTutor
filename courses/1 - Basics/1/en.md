## What are Variables?

Variables are like **boxes** that hold information. You can put numbers, text, or other things in them and use them later!

### 🎨 About the Drawing Functions:

- `drawCircle(x, y, radius, color)` - The first number (`x`) is how many pixels from the LEFT edge to place the center. The second number (`y`) is how many pixels from the TOP edge. The radius is how big the circle is (like measuring from the center to the edge).
- `drawText(x, y, text, color)` - Places text at a position. `x` is pixels from left, `y` is pixels from top.

### 📍 Canvas Coordinates

Think of the canvas like a grid: `(0,0)` is the top-left corner, `(400,400)` is the bottom-right!

### 🌟 Your Challenge:

After trying the example, clear the code and write your own! Try creating a variable with your favorite number, then draw a circle using that number. Can you draw your initials on the canvas too?
