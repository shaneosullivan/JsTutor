## Shortcuts with Math

Sometimes you want to change a variable by adding or subtracting from it. There are shortcuts that make this easier!

### ðŸš€ Math Shortcuts:

- `+=` means 'add to this variable' (like `score += 10` means `score = score + 10`)
- `-=` means 'subtract from this variable' (like `lives -= 1` means `lives = lives - 1`)
- `*=` means 'multiply this variable' (like `size *= 2` means `size = size * 2`)
- `/=` means 'divide this variable' (like `speed /= 2` means `speed = speed / 2`)

### âœ¨ Why Use Shortcuts?

- They're faster to type
- They're easier to read
- They help prevent mistakes
- Real programmers use them all the time!

### ðŸŒŸ Your Challenge:

Try changing the code to use different shortcuts. What happens if you use `*=` instead of `+=`? Can you make the squares get smaller instead of bigger?
