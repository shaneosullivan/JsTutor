// Let's create our first variable!
// This grey text is called a 'comment'. It doesn't
// affect the code, it's just for us to read.
// You make one by putting two slashes (//) at
// the start of a line.

// To create a variable, we use the keyword 'let'
// followed by the name we want to give it.
// Then we put some information inside the
// variable by using the equals sign (=), followed
// by the value we want to store.

let myName = "Your Name";
let age = 9;

// Now let's draw something using our variables
drawCircle(200, 200, age * 5, "blue");
drawText(200, 300, myName, "black");
