## Math Operations in JavaScript

JavaScript can do maths just like you! You can add `+`, subtract `-`, multiply `*`, and divide `/` numbers.

### 🎨 New Drawing Function:

- `drawRect(x, y, width, height, color)` - Draws a rectangle! `x` and `y` tell us where the **TOP-LEFT** corner goes. `width` is how wide (left to right), `height` is how tall (top to bottom). Think of it like drawing a box!

### 🌟 Your Challenge:

Clear the code and try this on your own! Create variables for your age and your favorite number, then do some maths with them. Draw rectangles using the results - maybe make a building or a robot face!
